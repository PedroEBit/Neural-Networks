# Neural-Networks From Scratch!

Here I will be sharing my studies and creating a neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy.
I was driven to this study because of how fascinating neural networks are for me, and I wanted to really understand everything that happens behind the curtaings myself,
rather than just using it or just going through it briefly.
I will be attempting to build a whole multilayer neural network eventually, but that starts with a single perceptron, or rather a "single_perceptron.ipynb" lol
